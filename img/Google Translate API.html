<p>By using this API, you consent to be bound by these terms in addition to the Google APIs Terms of Service ("API ToS") at <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms">https://developers.google.com/terms</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Prohibitions</h2>
<p>You will not knowingly use the API to create, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) a substantially similar product or service, including any other machine translation engine.</p>
<h2>2. Submission of Content</h2>
<p>Google does not claim any ownership in the content that you submit or in the translations of that content returned by the API.</p>
<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>Google will not include advertising in the content returned through the APIs.</p>
<h2>4. HTML Markup Requirements</h2>

<h2>5. Fees</h2>
<p>The Google Translate API is provided to you without any free usage quota at all. You will be charged for each successful request you make through the Translate API. The usage charges for the Translate APIs ("Usage Charges") can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/pricing/">https://developers.google.com/cloud/pricing/</a>. The fees for Google technical support services (if applicable) are set forth in Section 7 below.</p>
<p>A bill will be issued to your online account for all Usage Charges accrued in a calendar month. You will be responsible for Usage Charges in your online account, and will pay all Usage Charges in U.S. Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties. Unless agreed to by the parties in writing, you will pay all Usage Charges in accordance with the following payment terms <a href="https://developers.google.com/console/help/#Billing">https://developers.google.com/console/help/#Billing</a>. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Usage Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Google incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Usage Charges are solely based on Google's measurements of your use of the Translate API, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Google and only in the form of credit for the Translate API. Nothing in these terms obligates Google to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Google may be shared by Google with companies who work on Google's behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Google and servicing your account. Google may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Google will not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Google reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Translate API to you for any late payments.</p>
<p>Google may change its fees and payment policies/charges for the Translate APIs with 90 days prior notice. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of these terms for any reason.</p>
<p>You may not access the Translate API in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>
